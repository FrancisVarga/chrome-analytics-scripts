# Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project is a sample Python package that demonstrates integration with release-please for automated releases. It provides simple greeting and calculation functionality to showcase how to structure a Python package with proper testing and CI/CD integration.

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Project setup and initial planning
- **Week 2-3**: Core development phase
- **Week 4**: Testing and bug fixes
- **Week 5**: Documentation and final review
- **Week 6**: Deployment and launch

## Milestones

1. **Project Initialization** - Complete by end of Week 1
   - Repository setup
     - GitHub Actions for auto-merging PRs and deleting branches
     - Automated release management with release-please
   - Documentation structure
   - Development environment configuration

2. **MVP Development** - Complete by end of Week 3
   - Core functionality implemented
   - Basic UI/UX elements
   - Initial integration tests

3. **Quality Assurance** - Complete by end of Week 4
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Bug fixes
   - Performance optimization

4. **Project Completion** - Complete by end of Week 6
   - Full documentation
   - Deployment
   - User training materials

## Resources

- **Development Team**: [Number] developers, [Number] designers
- **Tools**: [List of development tools, frameworks, libraries]
- **Budget**: [Budget information if applicable]

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Technical challenges | High | Medium | Allocate additional research time, consult experts |
| Timeline delays | Medium | Medium | Build buffer time into schedule, prioritize features |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Low | Identify backup resources, adjust scope if necessary |

## GitHub Actions Configuration

### Release Please Workflow

The release-please workflow has been configured to:

1. Run on pushes to the main branch
2. Use the googleapis/release-please-action@v4
3. Create release PRs based on conventional commit messages
4. When a release PR is merged:
   - Check out the code
   - Set up Node.js
   - Install dependencies
   - Build the project
   - Create source code archives (zip and tar.gz)
   - Upload the following to the GitHub release:
     - Source code archives (zip and tar.gz)
     - Assets from the assets directory (if it exists)
     - Build artifacts from the dist directory (if it exists)
     - Files from public, build, and docs directories (if they exist)

### GitHub Actions Permissions

To address the "GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests" error, the following repository settings need to be updated:

1. Go to repository Settings > Actions > General
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
4. Click "Save"

This will allow the default GITHUB_TOKEN to have the necessary permissions to create and approve pull requests, which is required for the release-please workflow to function correctly.

## Python Project Structure

The sample Python project has been structured as follows:

```
sample_python_project/
├── __init__.py        # Main package initialization with core functions
└── version.py         # Version information

tests/
├── __init__.py        # Test package initialization
└── test_sample_python_project.py  # Test cases for the package

# Project configuration files
pyproject.toml         # Modern Python packaging configuration
setup.py               # Package setup script
requirements.txt       # Development dependencies
LICENSE                # MIT License
README.md              # Project documentation
.gitignore             # Git ignore patterns
```

### Key Components

1. **Core Package**
   - `sample_python_project/__init__.py`: Contains the main functionality (greet and calculate functions)
   - `sample_python_project/version.py`: Manages version information

2. **Tests**
   - `tests/test_sample_python_project.py`: Contains unit tests for all functionality

3. **Packaging Configuration**
   - `pyproject.toml`: Modern Python packaging configuration (PEP 517/518)
   - `setup.py`: Traditional setup script for package installation

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases
   - `.github/release-please-config.json`: Configuration for release-please

This structure follows modern Python packaging best practices and provides a solid foundation for further development.
