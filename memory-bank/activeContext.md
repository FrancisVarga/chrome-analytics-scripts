# Active Context: Conversation Analytics Framework

## ULTRA IMPORTANT

**IGNORE ALL LINTING ERRORS OR ISSUES**

This is a critical directive for all development work on this project. Do not spend time fixing linting errors or issues. Focus on functionality and feature implementation instead.

**DO NOT SHOW IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARIES OR "TASK COMPLETED" SUMMARIES**

When completing tasks, do not include phrases like "I've successfully implemented..." or provide task completion summaries. Focus only on the technical implementation details and avoid meta-commentary about the work process.

## Current Focus

- Do not write tests for the modules until instructed otherwise.
- The database schema for conversations and messages has been documented in the memory bank, providing a clear reference for the data structure being processed.

The Conversation Analytics Framework is currently in the early stages of development, with a focus on establishing the core infrastructure and implementing key components. Based on the TODO list and project files, the following areas are currently being actively worked on:

### Database Schema Design

The MongoDB schema design is a high-priority task that is currently in progress. The `mongodb_schema.py` file contains comprehensive schema definitions for all collections, including:

- Conversation analytics
- Conversation messages
- Conversation categories
- Conversation translations
- Analytics reports
- User analytics

The schema includes validation rules, indexes, and Python data models for object-oriented interaction with the database. While the schema definitions are well-developed, there is still work to be done on:

- Creating database indexes for optimal query performance
- Documenting schema relationships and constraints
- Implementing schema validation rules in MongoDB

### Storage Implementation

The S3 Parquet storage module has been implemented, as indicated by the completed items in the TODO list. This includes:

- Uncommenting pandas, pyarrow, fastparquet, dask, and distributed dependencies in requirements.txt
- Implementing optimized file size and compression settings
- Adding partitioning by date for efficient querying

The MongoDB client implementation has been restructured into a modular design with specialized client classes:

- **MongoDBBaseClient**: Provides common MongoDB operations like CRUD, aggregation, and indexing
- **MongoDBConversationClient**: Handles conversation-specific operations
- **MongoDBAnalyticsClient**: Manages analytics reports and user analytics operations
- **MongoDBTranslationClient**: Handles translation-specific operations
- **MongoDBClient**: Main client that combines all specialized clients

This modular approach improves maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns. Each specialized client focuses on a specific domain, making the code more organized and easier to extend.

### Processing State Tracking

The processing state tracking system has been implemented, as indicated by the completed items in the TODO list. This includes:

- Creating local file-based state storage
- Adding S3-based state storage for distributed environments
- Implementing resumable processing based on last processed ID

### Multi-threading Support

Multi-threading support has been implemented, as indicated by the completed items in the TODO list. This includes:

- Implementing thread pool manager
- Adding thread-safe operations for shared resources

### Data Collection and Processing

The NocoDB API client and data processor are high-priority tasks that are currently in progress. These components are responsible for:

- Fetching conversation and message data from NocoDB
- Transforming raw data into analytics-ready format
- Implementing conversation processing logic
- Adding message processing and categorization

## Recent Decisions

Based on the project files and TODO list, the following recent decisions have been made:

1. **Dual Storage Strategy**: The decision to use both MongoDB and S3 Parquet for storage, leveraging the strengths of each for different use cases.

2. **Multi-threading Approach**: The decision to implement multi-threading for parallel processing, with a thread pool manager to control resource utilization.

3. **Processing State Tracking**: The decision to implement a robust processing state tracking system to enable resumable processing and error recovery.

4. **Parquet Optimization**: The decision to use Parquet for analytics storage, with optimized file size, compression, and partitioning settings.

5. **Pre-commit Hook**: The decision to implement a pre-commit hook for requirements.txt synchronization with uv, ensuring that dependencies are always up-to-date.

6. **Modular MongoDB Client Design**: The decision to split the MongoDB client into specialized modules for better maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns.

## Current Challenges

Based on the project files and TODO list, the following challenges are currently being addressed:

1. **NocoDB API Integration**: Implementing a robust API client that can handle pagination, filtering, and error recovery.

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Designing and implementing an efficient data processing pipeline that can handle large volumes of conversation data.

3. **MongoDB Schema Optimization**: Ensuring that the MongoDB schema is optimized for query performance and data integrity.

4. **Categorization Engine**: Enhancing the categorization engine with more sophisticated algorithms for topic, intent, and sentiment analysis. The basic implementation has been improved with context-aware scoring, weighted lexicons, and negation handling.

5. **Error Handling and Recovery**: Implementing comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure reliable processing.

## Next Steps

Based on the TODO list and project timeline, the following next steps are planned:

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Weeks)

1. **Complete MongoDB Schema Design**: Finalize the MongoDB schema design, including indexes and validation rules.

2. **Implement NocoDB API Client**: Complete the implementation of the NocoDB API client with pagination, filtering, and error handling.

3. **Enhance MongoDB Client Modules**: Add more specialized methods to the MongoDB client modules for specific use cases.

4. **Build Data Processor**: Implement the data processor for transforming NocoDB data to analytics format.

5. **Add Error Tracking**: Implement error tracking and recovery mechanisms for reliable processing.

### Medium-term (Next 3-4 Weeks)

2. **Create Analytics Aggregation Pipeline**: Implement daily/weekly/monthly report generation and user-based analytics.

3. **Add GPU Acceleration**: Implement GPU acceleration for computationally intensive tasks.

4. **Develop Incremental Data Collection**: Implement incremental data collection to minimize API load.

5. **Enhance Processing State**: Add detailed metrics and visualization for processing state.

### Long-term (Next 5-8 Weeks)

1. **Implement Advanced Analytics**: Add conversation quality scoring, user satisfaction metrics, and model comparison analytics.

2. **Create Translation Support**: Implement translation storage framework and retrieval API.

3. **Develop API Endpoints**: Create conversation retrieval API, analytics query endpoints, and user data access API.

4. **Set up CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement automated testing and deployment automation.
