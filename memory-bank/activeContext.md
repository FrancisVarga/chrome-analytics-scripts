# Active Context: Conversation Analytics Framework

## ULTRA IMPORTANT

**IGNORE ALL LINTING ERRORS OR ISSUES**

This is a critical directive for all development work on this project. Do not spend time fixing linting errors or issues. Focus on functionality and feature implementation instead.

**FOLLOW THE GENERAL RULES OF DEVELOPMENT**

Adhere to standard development practices and conventions. Write clean, maintainable code that follows established patterns and best practices.

**FOLLOW THE KISS PRINCIPLE**

Keep It Simple, Stupid. Always prefer simpler solutions over complex ones. Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complexity. Focus on readability and maintainability.

**DO NOT SHOW IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARIES OR "TASK COMPLETED" SUMMARIES**

When completing tasks, do not include phrases like "I've successfully implemented..." or provide task completion summaries. Focus only on the technical implementation details and avoid meta-commentary about the work process.

## Current Focus

- Do not write tests for the modules until instructed otherwise.
- The database schema for conversations and messages has been documented in the memory bank, providing a clear reference for the data structure being processed.
- A new HTTP client library has been implemented to support parallel requests, improving performance for I/O-bound operations.

The Conversation Analytics Framework is currently in the early stages of development, with a focus on establishing the core infrastructure and implementing key components. Based on the TODO list and project files, the following areas are currently being actively worked on:

### Database Schema Design

The MongoDB schema design is a high-priority task that is currently in progress. The `mongodb_schema.py` file contains comprehensive schema definitions for all collections, including:

- Conversation analytics
- Conversation messages
- Conversation categories
- Conversation translations
- Analytics reports
- User analytics

The schema includes validation rules, indexes, and Python data models for object-oriented interaction with the database. While the schema definitions are well-developed, there is still work to be done on:

- Creating database indexes for optimal query performance
- Documenting schema relationships and constraints
- Implementing schema validation rules in MongoDB

### Storage Implementation

The S3 Parquet storage module has been implemented, as indicated by the completed items in the TODO list. This includes:

- Uncommenting pandas, pyarrow, fastparquet, dask, and distributed dependencies in requirements.txt
- Implementing optimized file size and compression settings
- Adding partitioning by date for efficient querying

The MongoDB client implementation has been restructured into a modular design with specialized client classes:

- **MongoDBBaseClient**: Provides common MongoDB operations like CRUD, aggregation, and indexing
- **MongoDBConversationClient**: Handles conversation-specific operations
- **MongoDBAnalyticsClient**: Manages analytics reports and user analytics operations
- **MongoDBTranslationClient**: Handles translation-specific operations
- **MongoDBClient**: Main client that combines all specialized clients

This modular approach improves maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns. Each specialized client focuses on a specific domain, making the code more organized and easier to extend.

### Processing State Tracking

The processing state tracking system has been implemented, as indicated by the completed items in the TODO list. This includes:

- Creating local file-based state storage
- Adding S3-based state storage for distributed environments
- Implementing resumable processing based on last processed ID

### Multi-threading Support

Multi-threading support has been implemented, as indicated by the completed items in the TODO list. This includes:

- Implementing thread pool manager
- Adding thread-safe operations for shared resources
- Creating an HTTP client library with parallel request capabilities

The HTTP client library (`analytics_framework/utils/http_client.py`) provides a robust and flexible way to make HTTP requests, with support for parallel requests, retries, and response processing. It includes:

- **HTTPClient**: Core class for making HTTP requests with retry capabilities and parallel execution
- **APIClient**: Higher-level wrapper around HTTPClient that adds API-specific functionality like authentication
- Support for parallel GET, POST, and other HTTP methods
- Batch processing for large numbers of requests
- Response processing with custom functions
- Context manager support for clean resource management
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

The NocoDB client has been updated to use the new HTTP client library, demonstrating how it can be integrated into existing code. The updated client now supports parallel requests for fetching conversations and messages, improving performance for data collection operations.

### Data Collection and Processing

The NocoDB API client and data processor are high-priority tasks that are currently in progress. These components are responsible for:

- Fetching conversation and message data from NocoDB
- Transforming raw data into analytics-ready format
- Implementing conversation processing logic
- Adding message processing and categorization

The NocoDB API client has been enhanced with parallel request capabilities using the new HTTP client library, allowing it to fetch multiple conversations and messages simultaneously. This improves performance for data collection operations, especially when fetching large numbers of records.

## Recent Decisions

Based on the project files and TODO list, the following recent decisions have been made:

1. **Dual Storage Strategy**: The decision to use both MongoDB and S3 Parquet for storage, leveraging the strengths of each for different use cases.

2. **Multi-threading Approach**: The decision to implement multi-threading for parallel processing, with a thread pool manager to control resource utilization.

3. **Processing State Tracking**: The decision to implement a robust processing state tracking system to enable resumable processing and error recovery.

4. **Parquet Optimization**: The decision to use Parquet for analytics storage, with optimized file size, compression, and partitioning settings.

5. **Pre-commit Hook**: The decision to implement a pre-commit hook for requirements.txt synchronization with uv, ensuring that dependencies are always up-to-date.

6. **Modular MongoDB Client Design**: The decision to split the MongoDB client into specialized modules for better maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns.

7. **HTTP Client Library**: The decision to implement a dedicated HTTP client library with parallel request capabilities to improve performance for I/O-bound operations.

## Current Challenges

Based on the project files and TODO list, the following challenges are currently being addressed:

1. **MongoDB Client Interface Consistency**: Fixed an issue where `scripts/store_sample_data/storage.py` was trying to use a `bulk_write` method directly on the `MongoDBConversationClient` object, but this method only exists in the `MongoDBBaseClient`. The fix involved updating the code to use `mongodb_client.base_client.bulk_write(mongodb_client.conversation.collection, bulk_operations)` instead of `mongodb_client.conversation.bulk_write(bulk_operations)`.

2. **NocoDB API Integration**: Implementing a robust API client that can handle pagination, filtering, and error recovery.

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Designing and implementing an efficient data processing pipeline that can handle large volumes of conversation data.

3. **MongoDB Schema Optimization**: Ensuring that the MongoDB schema is optimized for query performance and data integrity.

4. **Categorization Engine**: Enhancing the categorization engine with more sophisticated algorithms for topic, intent, and sentiment analysis. The basic implementation has been improved with context-aware scoring, weighted lexicons, and negation handling.

5. **Error Handling and Recovery**: Implementing comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure reliable processing.

6. **API Client Performance**: Optimizing API client performance for large-scale data collection, including parallel requests, batching, and efficient error handling.
