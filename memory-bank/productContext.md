# Product Context: Conversation Analytics Framework

## Problem Statement

Organizations that use conversational AI systems generate large volumes of conversation data. This data contains valuable insights about user behavior, preferences, and needs, but extracting these insights manually is time-consuming and inefficient. Additionally, storing and analyzing this data at scale presents technical challenges.

Key problems this framework addresses:

1. **Data Silos**: Conversation data is often stored in isolated systems (like NocoDB) without integration with analytics platforms.
2. **Processing Complexity**: Raw conversation data requires significant transformation to be useful for analytics.
3. **Storage Efficiency**: Conversation data needs to be stored in formats optimized for both operational use and analytical queries.
4. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Processing large volumes of conversation data can be slow without proper optimization.
5. **Insight Generation**: Extracting meaningful insights from conversations requires categorization and aggregation.

## Solution Overview

The Conversation Analytics Framework provides a comprehensive solution for collecting, processing, and analyzing conversation data:

1. **Unified Data Pipeline**: Connects NocoDB (data source) with MongoDB (operational storage) and S3 Parquet (analytical storage).
2. **Automated Processing**: Transforms raw conversation data into analytics-ready format with categorization.
3. **Optimized Storage**: Uses MongoDB for flexible operational queries and Parquet files for efficient analytics.
4. **High Performance**: Leverages multi-threading and optional GPU acceleration for processing speed.
5. **Actionable Insights**: Generates pre-computed analytics reports for immediate use.
