# Project Brief: Conversation Analytics Framework

## Overview

The Conversation Analytics Framework is a comprehensive system designed to collect, process, and analyze conversation data from NocoDB and store it in MongoDB and S3 (as Parquet files) for efficient analytics. The framework enables organizations to gain insights from conversation data, track metrics, and generate reports.

## Core Objectives

1. **Data Collection**: Fetch conversation and message data from NocoDB API
2. **Data Processing**: Transform raw data into analytics-ready format
3. **Categorization**: Automatically categorize conversations by topic, intent, and sentiment
4. **Analytics**: Generate daily, weekly, and monthly analytics reports
5. **Storage Optimization**: Store data efficiently in MongoDB and S3 Parquet files
6. **Performance**: Utilize multi-threading and optional GPU acceleration for processing

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Collect conversation data from NocoDB API
- Process and transform data for analytics
- Categorize conversations automatically
- Store data in MongoDB for operational use
- Store data in S3 as Parquet files for analytics
- Generate analytics reports
- Support resumable processing
- Provide a command-line interface for operations

### Technical Requirements

- Multi-threading support for parallel processing
- Optional GPU acceleration for computationally intensive tasks
- Incremental data collection and processing
- Efficient data storage and retrieval
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Configurable via environment variables
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully collect and process conversation data from NocoDB
2. Accurately categorize conversations by topic, intent, and sentiment
3. Efficiently store data in MongoDB and S3
4. Generate useful analytics reports
5. Achieve high performance through multi-threading and GPU acceleration
6. Provide a reliable and user-friendly command-line interface

## Constraints

- Must work with Python 3.8+
- Optional dependencies on MongoDB and AWS S3
- Optional dependency on CUDA-compatible GPU

## Timeline

The project is divided into four phases:

1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-2): Set up project structure, implement basic clients, create core data processing logic
2. **Core Functionality** (Weeks 3-4): Implement S3 Parquet storage, add basic categorization, create analytics aggregation
3. **Advanced Features** (Weeks 5-6): Add GPU acceleration, implement advanced analytics, create translation support
4. **Optimization and Deployment** (Weeks 7-8): Optimize performance, enhance security, create deployment automation

## Stakeholders

- Data analysts who need insights from conversation data
- Developers who need to integrate with the framework
- Operations teams who need to deploy and maintain the framework
