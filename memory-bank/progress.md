### Data Models

- ✅ **MongoDB Schema Definitions**: Comprehensive schema definitions for all collections are implemented.
- ✅ **Python Data Models**: Object-oriented data models for MongoDB collections are implemented.
- ✅ **Index Definitions**: MongoDB index definitions for all collections are defined.

### Storage

- ✅ **S3 Parquet Storage**: The S3 Parquet storage module is implemented with:
  - ✅ Optimized file size and compression settings
  - ✅ Partitioning by date for efficient querying
  - ✅ Support for both S3 and local filesystem
- ✅ **MongoDB Client Structure**: The MongoDB client has been restructured into a modular design:
  - ✅ Base client with common MongoDB operations
  - ✅ Specialized clients for conversations, analytics, and translations
  - ✅ Main client that combines all specialized clients

### Utilities

- ✅ **Processing State Tracking**: The processing state tracking system is implemented with:
  - ✅ Local file-based state storage
  - ✅ S3-based state storage for distributed environments
  - ✅ Resumable processing based on last processed ID
- ✅ **Multi-threading Support**: Thread pool manager and thread-safe operations are implemented.

## Known Issues

1. **MongoDB Schema Implementation**: The MongoDB schema is defined but not yet implemented in the MongoDB client.
2. **NocoDB API Client**: The NocoDB API client is not yet fully implemented, which blocks data collection.
3. **Data Processor**: The data processor is not yet fully implemented, which blocks data transformation and analytics.
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms are not yet implemented.
5. **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests are not yet implemented.

## Next Priorities

Based on the current status and project timeline, the following priorities have been identified for immediate focus:

1. **Complete NocoDB API Client**: Finish implementing the NocoDB API client to enable data collection.
2. **Enhance MongoDB Client Modules**: Add more specialized methods to the MongoDB client modules for specific use cases.
